### Description ###

Probabilistic Fire Simulator (PFS) is an engineering tool for probabilistic fire risk assessment. PFS is implemented as a Microsoft Excel workbook with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) subroutines for statistics and interfacing with [Fire Dynamics Simulator](http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv) (FDS). PFS is developed by the [Fire and Evacuation Safety team](http://www.vtt.fi/research/technology/fire_safety_technology.jsp?lang=en) of VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland.

**Applications**

  * User interface for creating FDS input files
  * Framework for running Monte Carlo fire simulations and post-processing the results
  * Supports standard, nested and two-model Monte Carlo simulations

**Supported fire models**

  * Fire Dynamics Simulator
  * Excel worksheet models (i.e. analytical and probabilistic models)
